ZorkShell

I've always wanted to beat Zork,  the original text mode Dungeon game.

Every time I've started,  I've ended up keeping multiple sets of notes
(in text files,  on paper,  etc.) about which rooms lead to which
others,  where I last saw a given item ... keeping them updated was a pain.
If you wrote the game today you'd probably include features to make
the game more playable,  like an online map and inventory tracker.

Alas,  the poor folks who implemented it long ago didn't;  probably
those features were next on the list when their lamp ran out of oil
and someone made the decision to "ship it anyway".

So I've been building them.  Call it cheating if you want.

Zorkshell (so far) will:

* save and restore multiple saved games (see /save and /restore) 
* build an interactive map as you walk around (see /loadmap and /savemap) 
* show you where exits from the room you're in go (see /map)
* help you navigate to a specific place (see /nav)
* keep track of where you last saw items (see /finditem)

Just clone this repository and run `zorkshell.py` at your commandline. 

Enjoy your adventuring.  Patches welcome if you can carry them out of
the cave with you.

Don't get eaten by a grue,

Will
